# Phenyl Game Engine
A WIP game engine written in C++, mainly focusing on 2D using an ECS design.
It features custom graphics using OpenGL as well as a custom physics system.

## Build instructions
### Requirements
Phenyl uses cmake with vcpkg in manifest mode for dependency management. Ensure that vcpkg is
appropriately set up for your environment.

### Instructions
**(WIP)** Phenyl should build like a standard cmake library.


## Examples
### Action game
My test project for the engine features. Build using the `action-game` target for a demonstration of implemented physics,
game logic, graphics and ui elements primarily used for testing.
